        <p className="text-md font-bold">America has been going through an obesity epidemic for over 3 decades with no signs of stopping.</p>
        <p className="italic">Did you know as of 2019, 39% of adults 18 years and older were overweight?</p>
        <p className="italic">Or that nearly 1 in 4 Americans are considered obese?</p>
        <p>Those stats only get more concerning when you consider the recent pandemic.</p>
        <p>
          While people were stuck at home waiting on their couches for the world to open up, 42% of adults in the US reported gaining “too much
          weight.”
        </p>
        <p>
          And when the American Psychological Association calculated those numbers, there was{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">an average weight gain of 29 pounds.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe some people put in the work, shed some fat, and are back to where they were pre-pandemic
          <span className="italic">—but what about the rest of us who put in the effort and still don’t see the results?</span>
        </p>
        <p className="italic font-bold">What about the people who’ve been struggling to change their body image since before the pandemic?</p>
        <p>Maybe you&apos;ve tried:</p>

        </ul>
        <p>Maybe you’ve tried everything under the sun, but the scale doesn’t budge despite your best efforts.</p>
        <p>
          And even if you found success with one of these methods, <span className="font-bold">it was probably short-lived.</span>

          Before coming to MD Exam, patients that did lose weight at some point reported keeping it off for no more than a couple of years (some
          saying they only kept it off for less than a month).
        </p>
        <p>If this sounds like you, that’s okay because it’s not your fault.</p>
        <p>
          The deck is stacked against you. In fact, it’s stacked against so many Americans out there struggling with their weight. Here are the 4
